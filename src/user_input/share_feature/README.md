This code creates three share buttons for Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. When a user clicks on any of the buttons, a new window opens with the 
corresponding social media share dialog. The URLs passed to the function are the share URLs for each social media platform, with the URL of the travel 
highlight as a parameter.
